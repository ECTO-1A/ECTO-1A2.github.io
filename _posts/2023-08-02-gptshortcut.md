# Siri Shortcut for ChatGPT

I created this Siri shortcut for iOS to integrate the capabilities of ChatGPT into Siri, giving me the ability to use ChatGPT via speach input and receive a spoken response.
Once installed on an iOS device, you will be able to use the shortcut with any of your Mac devices including the HomePod.

# How to use

- Install the official ChatGPT app from the App Store.
- Log in or create an account in ChatGPT.
- Install the iOS shortcut using the following link https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4ae3304051fd4b69b46622eea0661653
- The name of the shortcut is how it will be triggered. It is currently named "AI Mode" so to access, say "Hey Siri, AI Mode" and it will execute the shortcut.
- It then prompts if you would like to continue your conversation or start a new chat.
- All conversations are written back to the ChatGPT app.
