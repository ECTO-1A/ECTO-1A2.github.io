# SLIMY.CLOUD
Slilmy.cloud was the first AI app that I created. Its purpose was to:
- Provide GPT access to friends and family without needing to create an account 
- Showcase the functionality of different system prompts (with the ability to stack multiple)
- Showcase GPT in multiple "rolls" : Therapist, IT Technician, Language Tutor
