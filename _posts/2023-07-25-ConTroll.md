# ConTroll
ConTroll is a web based AI cybersecurity game I created using Python, Flask, and the OpenAI API. For this game, there is a hidden system prompt, just like every chat-bot being created today. Your goal is to enter something into the chat input field that will force OpenAI to reveal the password hidden in the system prompt.<br>
<br>
Each level has a different system prompt that uses various natural language methods to protect the information in that prompt.<br>
